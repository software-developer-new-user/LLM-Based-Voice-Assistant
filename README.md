# LLM-Based-Voice-Assistant

This is a voice assistant project based on large language models.

Generated response that mimics your speaking style to questions. Dialogues generated by human beings are provided in the Examples.txt as the training data for a specific style.

Adopted WeLM(a kind of LLM embedded in a social media app called Wechat) as the AI model.

Implemented AMeoGoe model which is a speech synthesis model to convert generated texts to voices and animation.
