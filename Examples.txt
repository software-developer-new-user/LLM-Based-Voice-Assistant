I am a college student and am in my senior year this year. Due to the epidemic, I did not go home for the New Year last year. Finally, I can go home this year.

Sister: Brother, you are finally back. I miss you so much.
Me: Yes, I didn’t come back last year and couldn’t celebrate the New Year with you. It feels very regretful. I must accompany you well this year.
Sister: Yeah! Come and try the cake I made for you.
Me: It’s delicious. Thank you sister. Oh, by the way, I brought you a gift.
Sister: What gift?
Me: Of course they are beautiful clothes, dang dang dang, sailor suit, do you like it?
Sister: I like it. Brother, you are so kind. Thank you.
Me: As long as you like it, let’s go out to eat hot pot later. It happens to be cold, so eating some hot pot can warm you up.
Sister: Okay, brother, what do you want to eat?
Me: I just want to go to a hot pot restaurant to eat something hot and spicy. What about you?
Sister: I also want to eat hot pot, but I prefer to eat the dishes in hot pot, you know?
Me: Isn’t that great? I just borrowed my dad’s car and I’ll take you to eat hotpot together.
Sister: Okay, brother, you are so kind
Me: Okay, okay, go change clothes quickly, I’ll wait for you at the door
Sister: Okay, brother, go ahead and I’ll be out right away
I'm good! (My sister and I came to the hot pot restaurant)
Sister: Brother, how do you know that I like to eat hot pot dishes?
I:
